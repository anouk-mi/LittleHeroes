const episodeContent = `The boy began his day by chopping wood. At dawn, amidst the wispy fog, he awoke, rubbing his eyes, and followed in his father's footsteps. Their life, emigrating from Kentucky to Indiana during the pioneering era, began with chopping wood. To build a log cabin, they had to fell trees, trim branches, and load them onto wagons, sweating profusely.

The boy was short and unsteady on his axe, but he dedicated every day to chopping wood, following in his father's footsteps. Beside the woodpile sat a basket of cornbread, handmade by his mother. As he ate it, he learned what it meant to grow up on the farm.

School was a luxury for him. The round trip from town to school was hours away, and during the busy farming season, he couldn't even set foot on the school's threshold. Yet, he never gave up on learning. He treasured a dusty book, and reading it by candlelight, without a flashlight, was a joy.

When his father asked, "Why do you read?" he replied, "Just as a knife's sheath deepens with each felling, I want my mind to accumulate thoughts."

He befriended William Shakespeare, the Bible, and characters from Aesop's fables, and he grasped the scale of the world by following its lines. Dusty hands, peeling heels, and rough knees were his school uniform, and the shade of a tree was his library.`;
